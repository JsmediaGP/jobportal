JOBPORTAL 

The database consists of three main tables: **Users**, **Companies**, and **Jobs**.

Users Table: This table stores user information searching for job.

Companies Table: This table holds company details.

Jobs Table: This table contains job listings.

These tables are connected through relationships:
 Users can have a role of user, admin, or company, and each user may have a company associated with them.
 Companies are linked to their admin users and can post multiple job listings.
 Job listings belong to specific companies.

This structure enables company job posting, user job search, admin job and account approval, and company and user account management within the job portal application.
